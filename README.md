# Mod 1 Week 5 Assessment

## Questions (10 Points Possible)
1. What would happen if you try to use a variable that is not in scope?

If you try to use a variable that is not in the scope, the program will show an error. The error occurs because when a variable is declared in a scope, you're not able to access and use that variable anywhere else but the scope where it was declared.

2. Describe the three As of a test:  
A - Arrange - Creating a new variable and assigning it to the testing objects
A - Act - Calling the method 
A - Assert - Testing to see if the method works as expected  

3. What is the difference between `public` and `private` access modifiers?

When using a public method, it makes it so any and all classes can access the code. With a private method, the code can only be accessed in the class where it was declared.

4. A method should:  (**Select all that apply**) <br/>
(A) Make changes to an object   
(B) Return some information about an object  
(C) Make changes to an object and return information about the object.  
(D) None of the Above.  

A

5. How did you determine what to answer for the question above?

All methods cause some type of change to occur in an object but not all methods return a value. Such as when the return type of a method is void.

## Exercise (10 Points Possible)

Clone your forked copy of this repository into Visual Studio.  

In this solution, there is a User project with a single User class.  The class works, but it needs some additional effort to be great! One thing that is missing is tests; your job is to write the tests that will confirm the functionality of the class. Write one test for the constructor, and at least one test for each of the other 4 methods. As you write the tests, you might find some refactoring opportunities; update the user class with any refactors you deem necessary and add a comment describing why you made that refactor.  The only rule is that all the existing methods must still exist when you are finished!


## Submission

When finished:
* Commit your changes in Visual Studio
* Push up to GitHub
* DM a link to your forked repository to your instructors
